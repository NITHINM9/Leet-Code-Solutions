# 📚 Leet-Code-Solutions and Algorithm Practice — Nithin

Welcome to my Algorithm & LeetCode Practice Repository!
This is my daily coding journal, containing solutions to problems from LeetCode and other algorithm practice sources.
I focus on data structures, algorithms, and pattern-based problem solving to become a better competitive programmer and software engineer.

🚀 Problem-Solving Patterns I Practice

I consistently apply and master the following algorithmic patterns:
Sliding Window – optimize subarray problems.
Two Pointers – solve problems with linear scans efficiently.
Fast & Slow Pointers – detect cycles, linked list tricks.
Recursion & Backtracking – explore all possibilities.
Binary Search – search in sorted arrays/logarithmic optimizations.
Prefix Sum – range sum queries in O(1).
Greedy Algorithms – local optimal → global optimal solutions.
Dynamic Programming (DP) – optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems.
Graph Traversal – BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms.
Heap/Priority Queue – scheduling & top-k problems.
etc......
